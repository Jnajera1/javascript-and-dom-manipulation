# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

### Data

The data.js file had more entries such as these two:

```javascript
var data = [{
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "benton",
    state: "ar",
    country: "us",
    shape: "circle",
    durationMinutes: "5 mins.",
    comments: "4 bright green circles high in the sky going in circles then one bright green light at my front door."
  },
  {
    datetime: "1/1/2010",
    city: "bonita",
    state: "ca",
    country: "us",
    shape: "light",
    durationMinutes: "13 minutes",
    comments: "Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010"
  }]
```

### Set Up

I used a premade index.html file with fancy bootstrap and images already chosen. I intend to come back through and customize the index.html and style.css with the latest bootstrap and my own design ideas. For now, I want to make sure my code works first, then I can move to design.


### Main File: app.js

In this file, I started with making more explicit variables than just 'data' in order to remember more easily throughout coding. If this file had been larger with many more functions, this would be especially important to think of from the start.

```javascript
var tableData = data;
var tbody = d3.select('tbody');
```




```javascript
```
